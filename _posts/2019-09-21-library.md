  At any campus, check out the [Library](https://library.tccd.edu) to find tons of resources including textbooks, headphones, laptops, and books that you can checkout. They also have great spaces for group and solo study sessions. If you prefer to study from home, you can still access hundreds of scholarly articles through their online databases.

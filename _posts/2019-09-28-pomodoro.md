title: Try the Pomodoro Method
description: |

  Use this technique to focus better during study sessions. The [Pomodoro Tracker](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) sets an alarm for you to study or work for 25 minutes, then take a short break for 5 minutes.  It's easier to convince myself to keep studying if I know that a break is coming up at a specific time.
